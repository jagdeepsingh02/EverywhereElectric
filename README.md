# EverywhereElectric  
See [project blog](https://hackaday.io/project/2484-everywhereelectric)  
This project is based on MotorWare v1.01.00.18.  
I've added the Hardware Abstraction Layer files to make the EverywhereElectric hardware work, along with the project files to use these within Code Composer Studio (CCS.) At this point, the Motorware Lab projects are stock, I'll add a full operational example shortly. 
  
The easiest way to get started is by cloning the project to your local machine using git, delete the motorware folder from your filesystem, Install motorware in it's place then `git checkout master` to overwrite the appropriate files.
You can then open up CCS and import the F28027 projects.
